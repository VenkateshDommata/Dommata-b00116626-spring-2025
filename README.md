## **Project: Drowsiness Detection Model using Deep Learning**

I worked on building a **drowsiness detection model** using deep learning. The key steps I completed are:

### **1. Dataset Processing:**
- Loaded images of **open and closed eyes** from the dataset.
- Created a structured **DataFrame** to store **image paths and labels**.

### **2. Data Augmentation & Preprocessing:**
- Used `ImageDataGenerator` to apply augmentations (**rotation, brightness, flipping**) to improve generalization.
- Split the dataset into **training, validation, and test sets**.

### **3. Model Development:**
- Used **MobileNet** as the base model (**without top layers**) for feature extraction.
- Added **custom layers** and trained a **binary classification model** using:
  - **Adam optimizer**
  - **Binary cross-entropy loss**
  - **Early stopping & model checkpointing** to prevent overfitting.

### **4. Training & Evaluation:**
- Achieved **98.7% accuracy** on the **training set** and **98.6% validation accuracy**.
- Evaluated the model on the **test set**, achieving **84.8% test accuracy**.
- Generated a **confusion matrix** and **classification report** to analyze model performance.

### **5. Predictions:**
- Tested the model on a **new image**, and successfully classified it as **open eyes** with high confidence.

## **6. Eye Detection with Haar Cascade (OpenCV)**
This week, I integrated **eye detection** using **Haar cascades in OpenCV**.  

ðŸ“Œ **How it works:**
- Used the **haarcascade_eye.xml** classifier to detect eyes from the webcam in real-time.
- Captured frames, applied the classifier, and **highlighted detected eyes with green rectangles**.
- The system continues detection **until the 'q' key is pressed** to stop the webcam feed.

### **Code Breakdown:**
âœ” **Initialization:**  
- The code accesses the **webcam** using `cv2.VideoCapture()`.  
- Haar cascade classifiers are loaded using `cv2.CascadeClassifier()`.  

âœ” **Detection:**  
- Each **captured frame** is converted to **grayscale** for better accuracy.  
- The `detectMultiScale()` method detects **eyes**.

âœ” **Output:**  
- The detected **eyes are highlighted** with rectangles.  
- The **resulting frame** is shown in a window.

## **Next Steps:**
âœ… **Real-Time Eye Status Detection:**  
- Implementing **real-time classification** of whether **eyes are open or closed**.  

âœ… **Frame Recognition Optimization:**  
- Fine-tuning the **frame rate** for better performance without excessive delays.  

âœ… **Drowsiness Alert System:**  
- In the next phase, if the driverâ€™s **eyes remain closed for too long**, the system will:  
  - **Trigger an alert sound (beep)** to warn the driver.
